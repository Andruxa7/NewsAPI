# NewsAPI App
iOS App to get news from https://newsapi.org

## About
NewsAPI app is a simple HTTP REST API for searching and retrieving live articles from all over the web.
The interface of my application consists of two screens: Top News and News by Category.
When you load the application, the first screen with the Top News opens. And on this screen, in addition to the Top News, there is a search bar. If we want to find news by some word or phrase, we just need to enter it into this search bar and press enter. And we will see the news that we requested.
And if we open the second screen called Categories, then seven categories are displayed there. When you select a category of interest, a new screen opens with news only on the topic of that category.
